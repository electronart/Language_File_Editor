# Language File Editor (LFE)
(LanguageUpdater was renamed to Language_File_Editor and made open source in October 2025.)

Language File Editor (LFE) is for editing .lang files. These are used for localization of our open source esearch-project as well as for other applications produced by ElectronArt Design Ltd such as the Database Indexer and 365 Indexer add-ons for dtSearch Desktop. Each product has its own master template.lang file in the original language (usually English).

A .lang file is a plain text file in UTF-8 encoding used for localization purposes in various applications, most famously in Skype and Minecraft. It maps key-value string pairs to provide translations or language-specific text for user interfaces or game menus.

Since .lang files are plain text, they can be edited using any text editor, such as Notepad or in Visual Studio Code. However, it is recommended to back up the original files to prevent issues.

Language File Editor provides a faster and more foolproof method to edit .lang files, showing word count, differences between localized versions and percentage translated.
